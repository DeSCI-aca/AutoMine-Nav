# AutoMine-Nav Dataset

A multimodal dataset for autonomous driving and robot navigation in mining environments.

## üìå Dataset Overview

AutoMine-Nav is a comprehensive dataset collected from open-pit mining areas, designed for autonomous vehicle localization and navigation tasks. The dataset includes synchronized data from multiple sensors:

- Ouster OS1-64 LiDAR
- Stereo Cameras (Left & Right)
- GNSS/INS System
- IMU
